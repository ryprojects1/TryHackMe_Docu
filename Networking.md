## OSI Model (7 Layers)

| Layer | Name | Function | Examples |
|-------|------|----------|----------|
| 7 | Application | Services & interfaces | HTTP, FTP, DNS, SMTP, POP3 |
| 6 | Presentation | Encoding, encryption, compression | Unicode, MIME, JPEG, PNG |
| 5 | Session | Establish & maintain sessions | NFS, RPC |
| 4 | Transport | End-to-end communication | TCP, UDP |
| 3 | Network | Logical addressing & routing | IP, ICMP, IPSec |
| 2 | Data Link | Reliable adjacent node transfer | Ethernet, WiFi (802.11) |
| 1 | Physical | Physical transmission media | Electrical, optical, wireless |

---

## TCP/IP Model

Simplified version of OSI - combines some layers:

- **Application Layer** = OSI layers 5, 6, 7
- **Transport Layer** = OSI layer 4 (TCP, UDP)
- **Internet Layer** = OSI layer 3 (IP, ICMP)
- **Link Layer** = OSI layer 2 (Ethernet, WiFi)

## Key Concepts

### Private IP Ranges (RFC 1918)
```
10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (10/8)
172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (172.16/12)
192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168/16)
```

### Port Numbers
- Valid range: 1 - 65535 (uses 2 octets)
- Port 0 is reserved
- Identifies processes/services on a device

### TCP Three-Way Handshake
How TCP establishes connection:
1. SYN (client sends sync request)
2. SYN-ACK (server acknowledges)
3. ACK (client acknowledges back)

### Encapsulation
Each layer adds a header (and sometimes trailer) to data:
- Application data → Transport layer adds TCP/UDP header → Segment/Datagram
- Gets passed down the stack with each layer adding its own header

## Protocols & Services

**TELNET**
- Teletype Network protocol
- Allows remote terminal connection
- Text-based commands over TCP
- Originally for remote admin (now less secure, use SSH)

**Common Lab Services:**
- Echo server (port 7) - echoes everything you send
- Daytime server (port 13) - sends current time/date
- HTTP web server (port 80) - serves web pages

#Networking Essentials
# Network Protocols: DHCP, ARP, ICMP & Routing

Essential protocols for network communication, device discovery, and diagnostics.

---

## DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

**What it is:** Application-level protocol that automatically assigns IP addresses to devices.

**How it works:**
- Server listens on UDP port 67
- Client sends from UDP port 68
- Used by default on smartphones and laptops

### DORA Process (4 Steps)

| Step | Packet | Direction | Purpose |
|------|--------|-----------|---------|
| 1. Discover | DHCPDISCOVER | Client → Broadcast | Client seeks DHCP server |
| 2. Offer | DHCPOFFER | Server → Client | Server offers available IP |
| 3. Request | DHCPREQUEST | Client → Broadcast | Client accepts the IP |
| 4. Acknowledge | DHCPACK | Server → Client | Server confirms IP assignment |

### Key Detail
Client starts with only a MAC address (no IP yet). In steps 1 & 3:
- Sends from IP `0.0.0.0` to broadcast `255.255.255.255`
- Uses broadcast MAC `ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff`
- Server responds using client's MAC address

---

## ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)

**What it is:** Finds MAC addresses of devices on the local network (Ethernet).

**How it works:**
```
Host A (192.168.66.89) → "Who has 192.168.66.1?" (broadcast)
Host B (192.168.66.1) → "That's me at MAC 44:df:65:d8:fe:6c" (unicast)
```

**Example:**
```
1 cc:5e:f8:02:21:a7 → ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff  Who has 192.168.66.1? Tell 192.168.66.89
2 44:df:65:d8:fe:6c → cc:5e:f8:02:21:a7  192.168.66.1 is at 44:df:65:d8:fe:6c
```

---

## ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)

**What it is:** Used for network diagnostics and error reporting.

### Ping
- Tests connectivity to a target
- Measures round-trip time (RTT)
- Determines if target is alive

### Traceroute
**Linux/Unix:** `traceroute`  
**Windows:** `tracert`

**How it works:**
- Uses Time-to-Live (TTL) field in IP packets
- Each router decrements TTL by 1
- When TTL reaches 0, router sends ICMP Type 11 (Time Exceeded)
- Reveals routers between your host and target

**What you learn:**
- ISP routers (may show private IPs)
- Public routers (can look up domain & location)
- Non-responding routers (drop packets silently)
- Some ICMP messages get blocked

---

## Routing Protocols

How routers communicate and choose paths for data.

### OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
- Routers share network topology information
- Calculates most efficient paths
- Each router builds complete network map
- Good for large, complex networks

### EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)
- Cisco proprietary protocol
- Combines multiple routing algorithms
- Routers share network reachability + cost info (bandwidth, delay)
- Faster convergence than OSPF

### BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)
- Primary routing protocol for the Internet
- Used between ISPs and large networks
- Exchanges routing info between different networks
- Ensures efficient routing across the entire Internet

### RIP (Routing Information Protocol)
- Simple protocol for small networks
- Routers share reachable networks + hop count
- Chooses routes with fewest hops
- Older, less efficient than modern protocols

#Networking Core Protocols

A record: The A (Address) record maps a hostname to one or more IPv4 addresses. For example, you can set example.com to resolve to 172.17.2.172.
AAAA Record: The AAAA record is similar to the A Record, but it is for IPv6. Remember that it is AAAA (quad-A), as AA and AAA would refer to a battery size; furthermore, AAA refers to Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting; neither falls under DNS.
CNAME Record: The CNAME (Canonical Name) record maps a domain name to another domain name. For example, www.example.com can be mapped to example.com or even to example.org.
MX Record: The MX (Mail Exchange) record specifies the mail server responsible for handling emails for a domain.

, we have used the whois command to look up a domain whose WHOIS record is protected by privacy protection.

Unlike HTTP, which is designed to retrieve web pages, File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is designed to transfer files. As a result, FTP is very efficient for file transfer, and when all conditions are equal, it can achieve higher speeds than HTTP.

Example commands defined by the FTP protocol are:

USER is used to input the username
PASS is used to enter the password
RETR (retrieve) is used to download a file from the FTP server to the client.
STOR (store) is used to upload a file from the client to the FTP server.
FTP server listens on TCP port 21 by default; data transfer is conducted via another connection from the client to the server.

In the terminal below we executed the command ftp 10.129.166.175 to connect to the remote FTP server using the local ftp client. Then we went through the following steps:

# Networking Core Protocols

## DNS Records
- **A Record** — Hostname → IPv4 address
- **AAAA Record** — Hostname → IPv6 address
- **CNAME Record** — Domain → another domain
- **MX Record** — Specifies mail server for a domain

## WHOIS
Lookup domain registration info. Privacy protection replaces owner details with a proxy service.
```bash
whois example.com
```

## FTP — Port 21
Designed for file transfer. Uses two connections: port 21 (control) + dynamic port (data).

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `USER` / `PASS` | Login credentials |
| `RETR` | Download file |
| `STOR` | Upload file |
| `get <file>` | Retrieve file |

Anonymous login: username `anonymous`, no password required.  
⚠️ Plaintext protocol — use SFTP/FTPS for secure transfer.

## SMTP — Sending Email
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `EHLO` | Start session |
| `MAIL FROM` | Sender address |
| `RCPT TO` | Recipient address |
| `DATA` | Begin message content |
| `.` | End of message |

## POP3 — Receiving Email (downloads & deletes from server)
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `USER` / `PASS` | Authenticate |
| `LIST` | List messages |
| `RETR <n>` | Get message |
| `DELE <n>` | Delete message |

#Networking Secure Protocols 
Like SSL, its predecessor, TLS is a cryptographic protocol operating at the OSI model’s transport layer. It allows secure communication between a client and a server over an insecure network. By secure, we refer to confidentiality and integrity; TLS ensures that no one can read or modify the exchanged data. Please take a minute to think about what it would be like to do online shopping, online banking, or even online messaging and email without being able to guarantee the confidentiality and integrity of the network packets. Without TLS, we would be unable to use the Internet for many applications that are now part of our daily routine.

Nowadays, tens of protocols have received security upgrades with the simple addition of TLS. Examples include HTTP, DNS, MQTT, and SIP, which have become HTTPS, DoT (DNS over TLS), MQTTS, and SIPS, where the appended “S” stands for Secure due to the use of SSL/TLS. In the following tasks, we will visit HTTPS, SMTPS, POP3S, and IMAPS.

The first step for every server (or client) that needs to identify itself is to get a signed TLS certificate. Generally, the server administrator creates a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) and submits it to a Certificate Authority (CA); the CA verifies the CSR and issues a digital certificate. Once the (signed) certificate is received, it can be used to identify the server (or the client) to others, who can confirm the validity of the signature. For a host to confirm the validity of a signed certificate, the certificates of the signing authorities need to be installed on the host. In the non-digital world, this is similar to recognising the stamps of various authorities. The screenshot below shows the trusted authorities installed in a web browser.

HTTP
HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. It is basically HTTP over TLS. Consequently, requesting a page over HTTPS will require the following three steps (after resolving the domain name):

Establish a TCP three-way handshake with the target server
Establish a TLS session
Communicate using the HTTP protocol; for example, issue HTTP requests, such as GET / HTTP/1.1

We have used the TELNET protocol in the Networking Concepts room. Although it is very convenient to log in and administer remote systems, it is risky when all the traffic is sent in cleartext. It is easy for anyone monitoring the network traffic to get hold of your login credentials once you use telnet. This problem necessitated a solution. Tatu Ylönen developed the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol and released SSH-1 in 1995 as freeware. (Interestingly, it was the same year that Netscape Communications released the SSL 2.0 protocol.) A more secure version, SSH-2, was defined in 1996. In 1999, the OpenBSD developers released OpenSSH, an open-source implementation of SSH. Nowadays, when you use an SSH client, it is most likely based on OpenSSH libraries and source code.

OpenSSH offers several benefits. We will list a few key points:

Secure authentication: Besides password-based authentication, SSH supports public key and two-factor authentication.
Confidentiality: OpenSSH provides end-to-end encryption, protecting against eavesdropping. Furthermore, it notifies you of new server keys to protect against man-in-the-middle attacks.
Integrity: In addition to protecting the confidentiality of the exchanged data, cryptography also protects the integrity of the traffic.
Tunneling: SSH can create a secure “tunnel” to route other protocols through SSH. This setup leads to a VPN-like connection.
X11 Forwarding: If you connect to a Unix-like system with a graphical user interface, SSH allows you to use the graphical application over the network.

When the Internet was designed, the TCP/IP protocol suite focused on delivering packets. For example, if a router gets out of service, the routing protocols can adapt and pick a different route to send their packets. If a packet was not acknowledged, TCP has built-in mechanisms to detect this situation and resend. However, no mechanisms are in place to ensure that all data leaving or entering a computer is protected from disclosure and alteration. A popular solution was the setup of a VPN connection. The focus here is on the P for Private in VPN.

Almost all companies require “private” information exchange in their virtual network. So, a VPN provides a very convenient and relatively inexpensive solution. The main requirements are Internet connectivity and a VPN server and client.

The network diagram below shows an example of a company with two remote branches connecting to the main branch. A VPN client in the remote branches is expected to connect to the VPN server in the main branch. In this case, the VPN client will encrypt the traffic and pass it to the main branch via the established VPN tunnel (shown in blue). The VPN traffic is limited to the blue lines; the green lines would carry the decrypted VPN traffic.

Once a VPN tunnel is established, all our Internet traffic will usually be routed over the VPN connection, i.e. via the VPN tunnel. Consequently, when we try to access an Internet service or web application, they will not see our public IP address but the VPN server’s. This is why some Internet users connect over VPN to circumvent geographical restrictions. Furthermore, the local ISP will only see encrypted traffic, which limits its ability to censor Internet access.

In other words, if a user connects to a VPN server in Japan, they will appear to the servers they access as if located in Japan. These servers will customise their experience accordingly, such as redirecting them to the Japanese version of the service. The screenshot below shows the Google Search page after connecting to a VPN server in Japan.
